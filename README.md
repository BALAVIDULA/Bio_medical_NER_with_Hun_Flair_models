HunFlair is a state-of-the-art NER tagger for biomedical texts. It comes with models for genes/proteins, chemicals, diseases, species and cell lines. HunFlair builds on pretrained domain-specific language models and outperforms other biomedical NER tools on unseen corpora. Furthermore, it contains harmonized versions of 31 biomedical NER data sets and comes with a Flair language model ("pubmed-X") and FastText embeddings ("pubmed") that were trained on roughly 3 million full texts and about 25 million abstracts from the biomedical domain.
